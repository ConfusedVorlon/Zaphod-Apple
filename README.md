# Zaphod

Pre Production SDK for [Zaphod.App](http://Zaphod.App)

This is alpha-quality work in progress. I suggest linking to a specific commit in your swift package and testing updates manually.

## Installation

Add this to your project using Swift Package Manager. In Xcode that is simply: File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency... and you're done. Alternative installations options are shown below for legacy projects.
